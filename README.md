# Build your own **printf**

The printf function is a powerful device for printing numbers and other things stored in variables. With this power there is a certain amount of complexity. Taken all at once, the complexity makes printf seem almost impossible to understand. But the complexity can be easily unfolded into simple features, including width, precision, signage, justification, and fill. By recognizing and understanding these features, printf will become a useful and friendly servant in your printing endeavors.
